# eth-allowance
Find & revoke all the addresses that can spend your tokens

## How it works
This tool works by searching all your transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to find the approval transactions; from there you are then able to revoke each one or even visit their dapp (if available).

## Add your dapp to the list
Fork this repo and add your dapp to the list [here](https://github.com/James-Sangalli/eth-allowance/blob/develop/src/helpers/dapps.js), the more the merrier!
